description = "The significance of a trailing slash in URLs"

Trailing slash after domain has no significance whatsoever, but a trailing slash after a page does matter, though most webservers redirect one to the other.

I like to omit trailing slashes if the webserver fixes them to make the URLs take up less space or fewer bytes.

When linking between pages, if your page ends in a slash, relative links go to `./`, but otherwise they go to `../`. That is, on `/about` linking to `mission` goes to `/mission`, not `/about/mission`.

Note that if the server does not reappend the slash, relative links will probably break, so keep it. I try to use Zola's builtin `get_url` function as much as I can, but this doesn't work with posts I write in Markdown (all of them).
