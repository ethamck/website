> A tumblelog is a quick and dirty stream of consciousness, a bit like a remaindered links style linklog but with more than just links.

I don't like to keep links in my journal as they'll probably expire sometime in the future. Unlike my journal, I don't expect my site to stay up forever, so the medium is as fleeting as its outreaches.
