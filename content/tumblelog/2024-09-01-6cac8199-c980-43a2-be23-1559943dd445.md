Woohoo!

This site is now published online, like, for real actually.

<!-- more -->

I've spent what looks like the entire last month on it (whoops) and now it's on the real bona fide web!

The entire deployment is done off GitHub and Cloudflare Pages. I bought <samp>wayward.computer</samp> from them and it's been relatively smooth sailing.

Cloudflare is a strange company for my morals to deal with, because they're massive and block Tor users sometimes, but they're also friendly and don't block Tor users sometimes.

The site as it stands now is, in my opinion, *good enough* for real eyes to see. Even if after throwing so much effort at it I lose enthusiasm for writing, this is my space, and I own it.
