I recall in 2021 loving the <cite>Angel Beats!</cite> anime and opening so much that I looked it up online, and the first result was (still is) [a reupload by one chidori909](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zIFV8UUs1-c).

On this video, random people, from many unique walks of life, were so touched by this art that they decided to write a daily microblog in the video's comments section.

The first time I saw the video, I did notice that a user, allegedly <samp>Zet#6788</samp> on Discord and usernamed Zet on YouTube, commenting his log over time. I found it quaint and didn't do anything to it, and I regret that deeply now, because he has since deleted his channel.

Regardless of this, there exists [an archive of his comments](https://gist.github.com/Widowan/4f9bea8bd0a4b0acdc003f0ea1a987a3) after a small bit of searching, but it seems that this is the only one on the clearnet, and it's missing many of his comments. I've archived it on Wayback, too.

The thing is, many other people have also written their logs inspired by Zet, and from what I can tell, Zet himself was inspired by someone else doing the same. In 2024, it has over 40 thousand comments.

All of this is why [Angel Beats](angel-beats/) is the first of these pages.
