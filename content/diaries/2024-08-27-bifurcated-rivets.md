[Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets weblog](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets) is one mouthful, but is also a massive tumblelog, and one that is cited in [Jason Kottke's post on the matter](https://kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs), which [I cite myself](@/tumblelog/_index.md) as the definition to the term.

It's been ongoing since 1999, and has short commentary on many things that Marshall has done or encountered, while also keeping a lovely early-web aesthetic, even though it's gone through [its fair share of redesigns](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/).

If you're looking for something that starts when the web was just getting on its feet, this could be a good read.
