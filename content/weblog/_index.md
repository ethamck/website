The title and link to this page is "<samp>weblog</samp>", which is in reference to the etymology of "blog". As [Cadence](https://cadence.moe) writes [in an explanatory post](https://cadence.moe/blog/2022-11-18-latest-changes-to-my-website),

> The [story behind the word weblog](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530144950/http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html) is that diaries, or logs of one's activities, when on the web, were called weblogs (web-logs). This was shortened to "blog" somewhere around the mid-2000s.

> Me using the word "weblog" rather than the now-meaningless "blog" is an attempt to fight back against [companies running self-described blogs.]

Wikipedia has some [further reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#History) on the term.

You can also [browse by tag](/tags), but this may include posts from different logs.
